      An overview of federal and state laws governing special education eligibility, services, procedural safeguards, and ARD processes.

  <section class="section">
    <h3>Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act</h3>
    <p>
      Section 504 is a federal civil rights law that ensures students with disabilities have equal access to education. 
      A student qualifies for a 504 Plan if they have a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or 
      more major life activities. A 504 Plan provides accommodations—not specialized instruction—to allow access to the 
      general education curriculum.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h3>Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)</h3>
    <p>
      IDEA guarantees a <strong>Free Appropriate Public Education (FAPE)</strong> to eligible students with disabilities. 
      It includes:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Requirements for evaluation and eligibility</li>
      <li>Development of an Individualized Education Program (IEP)</li>
      <li>Procedural safeguards for families</li>
      <li>Special education and related services tailored to individual needs</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      IDEA ensures that students receive specially designed instruction, progress monitoring, and legally protected support.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h3>Free Appropriate Public Education (FAPE)</h3>
    <p>
      FAPE means educational services must be individualized, data-driven, and designed to provide meaningful educational 
      benefit. The U.S. Supreme Court requires that IEPs be “reasonably calculated to enable a child to make progress 
      appropriate in light of the child’s circumstances” (<em>Endrew F., 2017</em>).
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h3>Least Restrictive Environment (LRE)</h3>
    <p>
      LRE requires districts to educate students with disabilities alongside nondisabled peers to the maximum extent 
      appropriate. Removal to a specialized setting occurs only when the nature or severity of the disability prevents 
      meaningful progress in the general education classroom—even with supports.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h3>Child Find Obligations</h3>
    <p>
      School districts must identify, locate, and evaluate all children who may have disabilities and need special 
      education services. Child Find applies to:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Students enrolled in public school</li>
      <li>Highly mobile students</li>
      <li>Private and homeschooled students</li>
      <li>Students experiencing homelessness or foster care</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Prompt referrals and timely evaluations are critical responsibilities of the district and educational diagnosticians.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h3>Procedural Safeguards</h3>
    <p>
      Procedural safeguards protect the rights of students with disabilities and their parents. These include:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Prior written notice</li>
      <li>Informed consent</li>
      <li>Access to educational records</li>
      <li>Independent Educational Evaluation (IEE)</li>
      <li>Mediation and due process hearings</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Region 18 ESC provides parent-friendly procedural safeguard documents, training, and resources to support districts.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h3>ARD Committee Process</h3>
    <p>
      Texas uses the term <strong>Admission, Review, and Dismissal (ARD)</strong> committee for the team that develops 
      and reviews the IEP. The ARD committee includes:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Parent or guardian</li>
      <li>General education teacher</li>
      <li>Special education teacher</li>
      <li>Campus or district representative</li>
      <li>Evaluation specialist or diagnostician</li>
      <li>Related service providers (as needed)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      A well-run ARD meeting is collaborative, respectful, and grounded in data.  
      The committee ensures that the IEP reflects student needs, strengths, and services required for success.
    </p>

    <h3>Final Project – EDUA 5321: Special Education Law</h3>
    <p>
      This project analyzes federal and Texas special education case law and illustrates how FAPE, LRE, Child Find, 
      procedural safeguards, and ARD processes are applied in real cases.
